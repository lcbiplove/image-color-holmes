# Project Overview: Image Color Analysis Web App

### Objective

The project aims to build a web application that allows users to upload an image, analyzes the image to detect the prominent colors used, and returns these colors with their corresponding hex codes and percentage of occupancy in the image. The application leverages the K-Means clustering algorithm for color detection, with AWS EC2 and S3 services supporting the infrastructure.

### Technologies Used

- Flask Framework: Serves as the backend of the web application, handling HTTP requests, managing sessions, and connecting the frontend to the backend.
- AWS S3: Used for storing uploaded images securely in the cloud.
- AWS EC2: Hosts the Flask application, ensuring that it is accessible over the web.
- K-Means Clustering Algorithm: A machine learning algorithm used for color detection in the uploaded images.
- Python: For the implementation of the algorithm and handling image processing tasks.

### Workflow

- Image Upload: Users upload an image via the web interface.
- Storage: The image is uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket.
- Processing:
- The Flask backend retrieves the image from S3.
- The K-Means algorithm is applied to identify the dominant colors in the image.
- The colors are then converted to hex codes, and their percentage of occupancy in the image is calculated.

### Results
The web application displays the detected colors, their hex codes, and their respective percentages.

### Future Enhancements:

- Improved Image Processing:
- Advanced Algorithms: Improve color detection accuracy with more sophisticated algorithms.
- User Accounts: Add user authentication and save analysis history.
- Batch Processing: Allow multiple images to be analyzed at once.
- API Integration: Provide an API for external use.
- Enhanced UI/UX: Improve the frontend design and user experience.
- Export Options: Enable downloading results in formats like CSV or PDF.
- Mobile Support: Develop a mobile version of the app.
- Design Tool Integration: Integrate with tools like Photoshop or Figma.
- Performance Optimization: Enhance speed and efficiency, especially for large images.
